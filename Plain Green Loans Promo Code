What do we know about the demographics and preferences of payday loan borrowers?

A: One reason The Pew Charitable Trusts created its consumer finance project in 2010 was to help fill an important gap in the research. Back then, surprisingly little was known about who uses payday loans or why, and about the experiences and opinions of payday loan borrowers. Pew’s Payday Lending in America series of reports, based in part on a survey of nearly 50,000 adults and a great deal of market research, filled in those gaps. The series includes four in-depth reports about payday loans, plus a related report about auto title loans. A companion report examined installment loans from consumer finance companies.

Our research identified groups that were disproportionately likely to use payday loans: renters, African Americans, people ages 25-44, parents of minor children, and those earning less than $40,000. Through surveys and focus groups, it became clear that borrowers valued the liquidity that payday loans offer but also wanted the loans to have fair prices and affordable payments. We found that the large majority would prefer to borrow small installment loans or lines of credit with fair terms from their banks or credit unions—which we know they already use, because payday loans require borrowers to have an income and a checking account—rather than take out payday loans. But at the time, no large banks offered such loans, so we pursued making that a reality.
